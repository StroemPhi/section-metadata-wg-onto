conform to CDIF. The content of these files should be a CDIF conform knowledge graph that contains necessary the 
domain-independent metadata of a dataset (e.g. author, date, ...) as well as domain-specific metadata (e.g. used 
observation method/tools, ...)

# File naming conventions
Please use the following file naming convention:

```
[ConsortiumAcronym]_CDIF_ex_[integer].[ttl/jsonld] 
example: NFDI4Chem_CDIF_ex_1.ttl
```
